# Neural-Net-Playground (In Progress)
A remake of TensorFlow playground in pure java.

A Neural Network playground application where the user can add layers, activation functions, and customize their neural network to fit some data. (This will be similar to TensorFlow playground)

Features include:
* Specifying number of neurons per layer
* Adding however many layers to the network
* Choosing activation functions
* Visualizing how the model fits the data
* Graphs showing training/validation loss per epoch

## What will the application do?
This application will simulate how a neural network will fit/not fit to some data, allowing the user to customize their neural net to their liking. 
## Who will use it?
Anybody interest in machine learning or beginners getting into it.
## Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is of interest for me because I love machine learning and TensorFlow playground was a big inspiration for me when I first started.

## User stories
* As a user, I want to be able to add a new layer to my neural network and specify the number of neurons and the activation function.
* As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all layers currently in my model, showing their type, dimensions, and parameter counts.
* As a user, I want to be able to visualize the loss of the model as it trains.
* As a user, I want to be able to choose the dataset the model is going to train on.
